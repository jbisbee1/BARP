\usage{
\method{plot}{bpd}(bpd, var_names = NULL, var_labs = NULL,
  is_categorical = NULL, cols = c("#f2f0f7", "#cbc9e2", "#9e9ac8",
  "#6a51a3"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{bpd}{A \code{\link{barp_partial_dependence}} partial dependence object of class "bpd".}

\item{var_names}{A vector of variable names. If \code{NULL} (the default), the variable names from the training data columns are used.}

\item{var_labs}{A list of variable labels corresponding to the levels at which the partial dependence was calculated. If \code{NULL} (the default), the raw values are used.}

\item{is_categorical}{A vector of logicals (T,F) corresponding to which variables are categorical and which are continuous.If \code{NULL} (the default), the function determines whether each variable is categorical or continuous based on the data class.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to plot.}
}
\description{
This function plots the partial dependence results estimated returned by running barp_partial_dependence.
